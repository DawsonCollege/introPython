# now I am using variables 
# variables are named containers 

# they can be any name, I chose msg
# here I put a string into a variable
# Think of a box, you write on the outside of it that is the variable name
# and you put things in it
msg = "Hello World"


# display a variable ?  
# nope the " " mean it is a string m s g 
print("msg")

# display a variable ! 
print(msg)


# change the variable content
msg = "Bonjour Monde"
print(msg)
